===============

Welcome to the `py_guitar_synth` project documentation! This project focuses on synthesizing realistic guitar sounds based on guitar tab sheets, simulating the physical and musical characteristics of strings and performance techniques.

Project Overview
----------------

`py_guitar_synth` translates guitar tab notation into audio, allowing users to generate guitar sounds by defining the instrument's physical characteristics, plucking techniques, and processing effects like convolution and echo. The generated sound is synthesized by modeling string vibrations, transitions, and harmonic properties.

Installation
------------

To install the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/py_guitar_synth.git
   cd py_guitar_synth
   pip install -r requirements.txt

You can also install it as a package by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .

Tab Syntax
----------

The guitar tab sheets used in this project follow a specific syntax to define frets, notes, and other musical elements. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the syntax:

### Strings

Each string is represented by a line with the corresponding string name:
- `e`: High E string
- `B`: B string
- `G`: G string
- `D`: D string
- `A`: A string
- `E`: Low E string

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    e|-3---|
    B|-----|
    G|-----|
    D|-----|
    A|-----|
    E|-----|

This example shows that the third fret on the high `e` string is played.

### Frets

Numbers represent the frets, while letters `a` to `f` are used for frets 10-15:

.. code-block:: bash

    e|--a---3--|  # Fret 10 on high E, fret 3 next

### Note Values

Symbols are used to represent note durations:
- `!`: Eighth note (`NoteValue.eighthNote`)
- `!!`: Sixteenth note (`NoteValue.sixteenthNote`)
- `+`: Half note (`NoteValue.halfNote`)
- `++`: Whole note (`NoteValue.wholeNote`)
- No symbol: Defaults to a quarter note (`NoteValue.quarterNote`)

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    e|-3+---3!!--|  # Half note followed by a sixteenth note

### Let Ring

To indicate that a note should sustain beyond its nominal duration, the letter `r` is used:

.. code-block:: bash

    e|-3r--|

### Chords and Simultaneous Notes

Notes played simultaneously across different strings can be written in a vertical column:

.. code-block:: bash

    e|-3--|
    B|-0--|
    G|-0--|

This represents an E minor chord.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    e|-3!-3r--|   # Eighth note followed by let ring

Modules
-------

Below are the key modules that make up the `py_guitar_synth` project.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   py_guitar_synth/instruments
   py_guitar_synth/sheets
   py_guitar_synth/tab_parser
   py_guitar_synth/signal_processing
   py_guitar_synth/types
   py_guitar_synth/instrument_parser

Usage
-----

Here is a simple usage example demonstrating how to synthesize a guitar sequence:

.. code-block:: python

   from py_guitar_synth import default_classical_guitar, law_bass_f_aini, generate_guitar_signal_from_sheet
   import sounddevice as sd

   # Generate the guitar signal from a sheet
   signal = generate_guitar_signal_from_sheet(
       instrument=default_classical_guitar,
       sheet=law_bass_f_aini
   )

   # Play the generated sound
   sd.play(signal, 44100)
   sd.wait()

You can customize the instrument, apply effects such as convolution with impulse responses, and even add echo to simulate room acoustics.
